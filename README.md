## Dashboard: **Text Mining on Islamic State Posts** 

# Project Background 
- Project Background
Hence the name, the Islamic State is a religion-based organization. According to Wikipedia, the Islamic State ideology is based on Salafism, Salafi Jihadism, and Wahhabism. The Islamic State leader Abu Omar al-Baghdadi defined its creed as a middle way between the extremist Kharijites and lax Murjities, which represents radical Salafi Islam, a strict, puritanical form of Sunni Islam. The Islamic State promotes religious violence and opposed Muslims who do not agree with its interpretations as infidels. In early 2014, the Islamic State used mainstream platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube to promote their organization and recruitsâ€™ fighters by posting shared photos of countless murders, executions, and battlegrounds. Since the large social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter removed the Islamic State content. They have chosen to utilize other social media platforms that either protect their content or allow the user to repost the content. These platforms of choice are Telegram, JustPasteIt, and Surespot. The purpose of this project is to extract the contents from JustPasteIt (text, images, and links) using the Google search engine, and perform analysis on them.
